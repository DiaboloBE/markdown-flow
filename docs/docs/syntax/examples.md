## Best Practices for Complete Templates

### 1. Progressive Complexity

Start simple and build complexity based on user responses:

```markdown
## Getting Started

What's your experience level?
?[%{{level}}Beginner|Advanced]

If {{level}} is "Beginner":
[Simple content and options]

If {{level}} is "Advanced":
[Complex content and more options]
```

### 2. Maintain Context

Reference previous choices throughout:

```markdown
Earlier you mentioned {{previous_choice}}.
Building on that, let's explore...
```

### 3. Provide Value at Each Step

Each interaction should deliver immediate value:

```markdown
You selected {{option}}.
Here's what that means for you: [immediate insight]
Let's dive deeper: [continued interaction]
```

### 4. Clear Navigation

Help users understand where they are:

```markdown
## Step {{current_step}} of {{total_steps}}: {{step_title}}

Previous: {{previous_step}}
Next: {{next_step}}
```

### 5. Graceful Fallbacks

Handle edge cases:

```markdown
If the user's input "{{input}}" doesn't match expected patterns:
Ask for clarification
Provide examples
Offer default option
```

## Testing Your Templates

Before deploying, test:

1. **All Paths**: Try every combination of choices
2. **Edge Cases**: Unusual inputs or combinations
3. **Variable States**: Missing or empty variables
4. **User Experience**: Is the flow logical and engaging?
5. **AI Interpretation**: Are instructions clear and unambiguous?
