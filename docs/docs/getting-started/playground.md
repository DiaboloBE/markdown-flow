## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Personal Introduction

Create a template that generates personalized introductions.

**Your task:**

```markdown
# Meet {{name}}

What's your role?
?[%{{role}}Student|Teacher|Developer|Designer|Entrepreneur]

What's your main interest?
?[%{{interest}}Technology|Arts|Business|Science|Sports]

---

Generate a compelling personal introduction for {{name}}.
- Mention their role as {{role}}
- Connect their interests in {{interest}} to their professional life
- Keep it warm and engaging
- End with an interesting question to start conversations
```

### Exercise 2: Learning Path Creator

Build a template that creates customized learning paths.

**Your task:**

```markdown
# Your Learning Journey

What do you want to learn?
?[%{{subject}}Web Development|Data Science|Design|Marketing|Photography]

How much time do you have per week?
?[%{{time}}2-5 hours|5-10 hours|10+ hours]

What's your preferred style?
?[%{{style}}Videos|Books|Hands-on projects|Online courses]

---

Create a 30-day learning plan for {{subject}} with these parameters:
- Time available: {{time}} per week
- Learning style: {{style}}
- Include specific milestones for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4
- Suggest 3 resources that match their {{style}} preference
```

### Exercise 3: Content Personalization

Practice adapting the same information for different audiences.

**Your task:**

```markdown
# Understanding AI

Who are you?
?[%{{audience}}Business Executive|Technical Professional|Student|General Public]

What's your main concern about AI?
?[%{{concern}}Job displacement|Privacy|Ethics|Technical complexity]

---

Explain artificial intelligence to {{audience}}, addressing their {{concern}}.

Adaptation guidelines:
- For executives: focus on business impact and ROI
- For technical professionals: include implementation details
- For students: emphasize learning opportunities
- For general public: use everyday analogies

Address their specific {{concern}} with factual, balanced information.
```

## Advanced Techniques to Try

### 1. Preserved Content

Practice using `===` for exact content preservation:

```markdown
Remember the golden rule of programming:
===Write code as if the person maintaining it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live===

Explain why this humorous quote actually contains serious wisdom
about code maintainability, especially for {{role}} working in {{industry}}.
```

### 2. Complex Interactions

Create multi-step user journeys:

```markdown
# Course Recommendation Engine

Step 1: Basic Info
?[%{{name}}...Your name]
?[%{{level}}Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced]

Step 2: Goals  
?[%{{goal}}Career change|Skill upgrade|Personal interest|Academic requirement]

Step 3: Preferences
?[%{{format}}Self-paced|Structured|Mentorship|Group learning]

---

Hi {{name}}! Based on your {{level}} level, {{goal}} goal, and {{format}} preference,
here are my personalized course recommendations...

[Continue with detailed recommendations]
```

### 3. Conditional Logic

Use if/then patterns for branching content:

```markdown
What's your current situation?
?[%{{situation}}Starting new job|Changing careers|Growing current role|Exploring options]

Generate advice specific to {{situation}}:

- If starting new job: focus on onboarding and relationship building
- If changing careers: emphasize transferable skills and networking
- If growing current role: suggest leadership development and skill expansion
- If exploring options: provide career assessment and discovery exercises
```

## Testing Tips

### 1. Try Different User Paths

Test your templates with various input combinations:

- Beginner + Career change
- Expert + Personal interest  
- Intermediate + Academic requirement

### 2. Check Edge Cases

- What happens with unusual names?
- How does it handle very short or very long inputs?
- Does it work with different languages/characters?

### 3. Validate Output Quality

- Is the generated content relevant and helpful?
- Does it maintain consistency across different user paths?
- Are the AI instructions clear and specific enough?

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Problem: Generic Output

**Symptom:** AI generates similar content regardless of user input

**Solution:** Make your instructions more specific

```markdown
# Too generic
Generate content for {{user_type}}.

# More specific
Generate content for {{user_type}}:
- If student: include study tips and deadlines
- If professional: focus on practical applications
- If hobbyist: keep it fun and experimental
```

### Problem: Variables Show as "UNKNOWN"

**Symptom:** Variables aren't being replaced properly

**Solution:** Ensure variables are collected before use

```markdown
# Wrong order - using before collecting
Welcome {{name}}!
?[%{{name}}...Enter name]

# Correct order - collecting before using
?[%{{name}}...Enter name]
Welcome {{name}}!
```

### Problem: AI Ignores Instructions

**Symptom:** Generated content doesn't follow your guidelines

**Solution:** Be more explicit and use examples

```markdown
# Vague
Write something interesting about {{topic}}.

# Explicit with examples
Write exactly 3 paragraphs about {{topic}}:
1. Definition and core concept
2. Real-world example from {{industry}}
3. Actionable next step for {{user_type}}
```
